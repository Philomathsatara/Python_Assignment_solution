# Write a programe to define a variable a=10 and b=20 and swap values of the variables. Output should display:
# initial value of a is: <actual vaule of a> and initial value of b is: <actual value of b>
# value of a after swap is: <actual vaule of b> and value of b after swap is: <actual value of a>

a = 10 # Defined Variable with hard coded values

b = 20 # Defined Variable with hard coded values

c = 0 # To swap the value took new variable

print ("initial value of a is:", a, "initial value of b is:", b) # print the result

c = a # Assign value of a to variable c

a = b # Assign value of b to variable a

b = c # Assign value of c to variable b

print("value of a after swap is:", a,"value of b after swap is:", b) # print the result
